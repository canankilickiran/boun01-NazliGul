## About Me

I am an industrial engineer who graduated from Yildiz Technical University in 2019. During my undergraduate education, I took part in many national and international student activities. Currently, I am studying my Master degree in Industrial Engineering Department in Bogazici University. I had the opportunity to work in fulltime and parttime jobs where I can gain experiences for my professional life related to my department. These companies include Schneider, Honda, UPS and Trendyol. However, after I started my master's education, I decided that I wanted to continue my career in academia. A good analysis and interpretation of data is of great importance for any scientific study. Since I want to draw my career as an academician, data science will be significant and helpful in my studies. My aim in taking this course is to improve myself on data science and to benefit from it in my future studies. For more detailed information about me, you can visit my Linkedin account:

### useR! 2020: Visualization of missing data and imputations in time series

In this video, Steffen Moritz, who is from the Institute of Data Science of TH Cologne, talks about the topic of Visualization of missing data and imputations in time series. Missing data is quite common, especially in sensor data due to the problems regarding data recording, data transmission, and data processing. The imputeTS package helps us to deal with these problems. The features of the package include three basic groups: *imputation, visualizaton*, and *stats-datasets*. The version 3.1 has new visualizations and currently available on github, and soon will be on CRAN. By using **ggplot_na_distribution** function, it is possible to have a good impression of missing values in the data set and the distribution of these values in the time series. Another function, namely **ggplot_na_gapsize** gives a ranking of the occurence of gap sizes. After this overview by using these two useful functions, we may continue by exploring imputation results. Also, **ggpot_na_imputations** function helps us to see how the imputted values fit into the time series. 
Stefen exemplified the use of 3 important ggplot functions in this video. In addition, many useful functions are included in the package. He also mentioned that the package is very user friendly.
